# UFO-Finder

## Overview of the analysis

Here in this project we became acquainted with the fundamental of Javascript and HTLM. First we went into the structure of the HTLM page with a table that comes with a filter that must be updated. The data is a bunch of UFO sightings that comes from a CSV, stored a list of dictionaries. There is a very specific structure to the static, js, and css files and how they link together. We updated the javascript to create event listeners to update forms and a way to iterate through the ids and tags that changed to update the form. 


## Results:

There is a description of how to perform a search, with images. 
Summary: To perform a search open the htlm file in a browser. Input changes into the fields at your discretion and the page will make changes automatically after clicking out of the field. A person can use the webpage to narrow down UFO sighting by using either a states initials, a date, city, county, or shape. You can see the page update as shown below.

## Summary: In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.

One drawback of this filtering form is that the filter is case sensitive and the while there are placeholder texts in the fields it's not immediatley clear what inputs the fields will accept. Two recommendations that could improve the page is make the filtering more robust, and creating a field so that people can input their own UFO sightings.
